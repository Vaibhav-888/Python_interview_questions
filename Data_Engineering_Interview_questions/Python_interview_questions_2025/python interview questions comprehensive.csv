287,Framework,Django,Explain how you can set up the Database in Django.,,Descriptive,1,"You can use the command edit mysite/setting.py , it is a normal python module with module level representing Django settings.
Django uses SQLite by default; it is easy for Django users as such it won’t require any other type of installation. In the case your database choice is different that you have to the following keys in the DATABASE ‘default’ item to match your database connection settings.
• Engines: you can change database by using ‘django.db.backends.sqlite3’ , ‘django.db.backeneds.mysql’, ‘django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2’, ‘django.db.backends.oracle’ and so on
• Name: The name of your database. In the case if you are using SQLite as your database, in that case database will be a file on your computer, Name should be a full absolute path, including file name of that file.
• If you are not choosing SQLite as your database then settings like Password, Host, User, etc. must be added.
Django uses SQLite as default database, it stores data as a single file in the filesystem. If you do have a database server—PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL—and want to use it rather than SQLite, then use your database’s administration tools to create a new database for your Django project. Either way, with your (empty) database in place, all that remains is to tell Django how to use it.
This is where your project’s settings.py file comes in.
We will add the following lines of code to the setting.py file:
1
2
3
4
5
6 DATABASES = {
     'default': {
          'ENGINE' : 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
          'NAME' : os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
     }
}",,,,
288,Framework,Django,Mention what the Django templates consists of.,,Descriptive,1,"The template is a simple text file.  It can create any text-based format like XML, CSV, HTML, etc.  A template contains variables that get replaced with values when the template is evaluated and tags (% tag %) that controls the logic of the template.",,,,
289,Framework,Django,List out the inheritance styles in Django.,,Descriptive,1,"In Django, there is three possible inheritance styles:
1. Abstract Base Classes: This style is used when you only wants parent’s class to hold information that you don’t want to type out for each child model.
2. Multi-table Inheritance: This style is used If you are sub-classing an existing model and need each model to have its own database table.
3. Proxy models: You can use this model, If you only want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without changing the model’s fields.",,,,
290,Framework,Flask,"Mention the differences between Django, Pyramid and Flask.",,Descriptive,1,"Flask is a “microframework” primarily build for a small application with simpler requirements. In flask, you have to use external libraries. Flask is ready to use.
• Pyramid is built for larger applications. It provides flexibility and lets the developer use the right tools for their project. The developer can choose the database, URL structure, templating style and more. Pyramid is heavy configurable.
• Django can also use for larger applications just like Pyramid. It includes an ORM.",,,,
291,Framework,Flask,Explain what is Flask & its benefits?,,Descriptive,1,"Flask is a web micro framework for Python based on ""Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions"" BSD licensed. Werkzeug and jingja are two of its dependencies.
Flask is part of the micro-framework. Which means it will have little to no dependencies on external libraries. It makes the framework light while there is little dependency to update and less security bugs.",,,,
292,Framework,Flask,Mention what is Flask-WTF and what are their features?,,Descriptive,1,"Flask-WTF offers simple integration with WTForms. Features include for Flask WTF are
• Integration with wtforms
• Secure form with csrf token
• Global csrf protection
• Internationalization integration
• Recaptcha supporting
• File upload that works with Flask Uploads",,,,
293,Framework,Flask,Explain how you can access sessions in Flask?,,Descriptive,1,"A session basically allows you to remember information from one request to another. In a flask, it uses a signed cookie so the user can look at the session contents and modify. The user can modify the session if only it has the secret key Flask.secret_key.",,,,
294,Concurrency,MultiThreading,How is Multithreading achieved in Python?,,Descriptive,1,"1. Python has a multi-threading package but if you want to multi-thread to speed your code up, then it’s usually not a good idea to use it.
2. Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL makes sure that only one of your ‘threads’ can execute at any one time. A thread acquires the GIL, does a little work, then passes the GIL onto the next thread.
3. This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your threads are executing in parallel, but they are really just taking turns using the same CPU core.
4. All this GIL passing adds overhead to execution. This means that if you want to make your code run faster then using the threading package often isn’t a good idea.",,,,
295,Libraries,Numpy,What advantages do NumPy arrays offer over (nested) Python lists?,,Descriptive,1,"1. Python’s lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They support (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending, and concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate.
2. They have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and the fact that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python must store type information for every element, and must execute type dispatching code when operating on each element.
3. NumPy is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You get a lot of vector and matrix operations for free, which sometimes allow one to avoid unnecessary work. And they are also efficiently implemented.
4. NumPy array is faster and You get a lot built in with NumPy, FFTs, convolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear algebra, histograms, etc. ",,,,
296,Libraries,Numpy,What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy?,,Descriptive,1,"1. In an ideal world, NumPy would contain nothing but the array data type and the most basic operations: indexing, sorting, reshaping, basic elementwise functions, et cetera.
2. All numerical code would reside in SciPy. However, one of NumPy’s important goals is compatibility, so NumPy tries to retain all features supported by either of its predecessors.
3. Thus NumPy contains some linear algebra functions, even though these more properly belong in SciPy. In any case, SciPy contains more fully-featured versions of the linear algebra modules, as well as many other numerical algorithms.
4. If you are doing scientific computing with python, you should probably install both NumPy and SciPy. Most new features belong in SciPy rather than NumPy.",,,,
297,Libraries,Numpy,How do you make 3D plots/visualizations using NumPy/SciPy?,,Descriptive,1,"Like 2D plotting, 3D graphics is beyond the scope of NumPy and SciPy, but just as in the 2D case, packages exist that integrate with NumPy. Matplotlib provides basic 3D plotting in the mplot3d subpackage, whereas Mayavi provides a wide range of high-quality 3D visualization features, utilizing the powerful VTK engine.",,,,
298,OOPS,Python Classes,Explain Inheritance in Python with an example.,,Descriptive,1,"Inheritance allows One class to gain all the members (say attributes and methods) of another class. Inheritance provides code reusability, makes it easier to create and maintain an application. The class from which we are inheriting is called super-class and the class that is inherited is called a derived / child class.
They are different types of inheritance supported by Python:
1. Single Inheritance – where a derived class acquires the members of a single super class.
2. Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 in inherited from base class base1, and d2 are inherited from base2.
3. Hierarchical inheritance – from one base class you can inherit any number of child classes
4. Multiple inheritance – a derived class is inherited from more than one base class.",,,,
299,Coding Analysis,Python Coding Analysis,What are the tools that help to find bugs or perform static analysis?,,Descriptive,1,PyChecker is a static analysis tool that detects the bugs in Python source code and warns about the style and complexity of the bug. Pylint is another tool that verifies whether the module meets the coding standard.,,,,

Every data type in python language is internally implemented as a class
Python language data types are categorized into two types.
They are:
• Fundamental Types
• Collection Types",,,,
303,Design Pattern,Python Decorators,Explain the use of decorators.,,Descriptive,1,"Decorators in Python are used to modify or inject code in functions or classes. Using decorators, you can wrap a class or function method call so that a piece of code can be executed before or after the execution of the original code. Decorators can be used to check for permissions, modify or track the arguments passed to a method, logging the calls to a specific method, etc.",,,,
304,Data Structures,Python Dictionary,What is dictionary in Python?,,Descriptive,1,The built-in datatypes in Python is called dictionary. It defines one-to-one relationship between keys and values. Dictionaries contain pair of keys and their corresponding values,,,,
305,Data Structures,Python Dictionary,What is Dict and List comprehensions are?,,Descriptive,1,They are syntax constructions to ease the creation of a Dictionary or List based on existing iterable.,,,,
306,Framework,Flash,Explain what Flask is and its benefits?,,Descriptive,1,"Flask is a web microframework for Python based on “Werkzeug, Jinja2 and good intentions” BSD license. Werkzeug and Jinja2 are two of its dependencies. This means it will have little to no dependencies on external libraries.  It makes the framework light while there is a little dependency to update and fewer security bugs.

307,OOPS,Python Functions,What is the usage of help() and dir() function in Python?,,Descriptive,1,"Help() and dir() both functions are accessible from the Python interpreter and used for viewing a consolidated dump of built-in functions. 
1. Help() function: The help() function is used to display the documentation string and also facilitates you to see the help related to modules, keywords, attributes, etc.
2. Dir() function: The dir() function is used to display the defined symbols.",,,,
308,OOPS,Python Functions,"What does this mean: *args, **kwargs? And why would we use it?",,Descriptive,1,"We use *args when we aren’t sure how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if we want to pass a stored list or tuple of arguments to a function. **kwargsis used when we don’t know how many keyword arguments will be passed to a function, or it can be used to pass the values of a dictionary as keyword arguments. The identifiers argsand kwargs are a convention, you could also use *bob and **billy but that would not be wise.",,,,
309,OOPS,Python Functions,What is the difference between range & xrange?,,Descriptive,1,"For the most part, xrange and range are the exact same in terms of functionality. They both provide a way to generate a list of integers for you to use, however you please. The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and x range returns an xrange object.
This means that xrange doesn’t actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. It creates the values as you need them with a special technique called yielding. This technique is used with a type of object known as generators. That means that if you have a really gigantic range you’d like to generate a list for, say one billion, xrange is the function to use.
This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such as a cell phone that you are working with, as range will use as much memory as it can to create your array of integers, which can result in a Memory Error and crash your program. It’s a memory hungry beast.",,,,
310,OOPS,Python Functions,What is map function in Python?,,Descriptive,1,"map function executes the function given as the first argument on all the elements of the iterable given as the second argument. If the function given takes in more than 1 argument, then many iterables are given. ",,,,
311,OOPS,Python Functions,What is pass in Python?,,Descriptive,1,"Pass means, no-operation Python statement, or in other words it is a place holder in compound statement, where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there.",,,,
312,Data Structures,Python Iterators,In Python what are iterators?,,Descriptive,1,"In Python, iterators are used to iterate a group of elements, containers like list.",,,,
313,Interfaces & Packages,Python Lambda,Why lambda forms in python does not have statements?,,Descriptive,1,A lambda form in python does not have statements as it is used to make new function object and then return them at runtime.,,,,
314,Interfaces & Packages,Python Lambda,What is Anonymous Function or Lambda Function?,,Descriptive,1,A function which doesn’t contain any name is known as an anonymous function lambda function,,,,

316,Data Structures,Python List,What is the difference between list and tuples?,,Descriptive,1,"LIST
Lists are mutable i.e. they can be edited.
Lists are slower than tuples.
Syntax: list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]


TUPLES
Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).
Tuples are faster than list.
Syntax: tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20)",,,,
317,Data Structures,Python Memory,How is memory managed in Python?,,Descriptive,1,"1. Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead.
2. The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
3. Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.",,,,
318,OOPS,Python Modules,"Whenever Python exits, why isn’t all the memory de-allocated?",,Descriptive,1,"1. Whenever Python exits, especially those Python modules which are having circular references to other objects or the objects that are referenced from the global namespaces are not always de-allocated or freed.
2. It is impossible to de-allocate those portions of memory that are reserved by the C library.
3. On exit, because of having its own efficient clean up mechanism, Python would try to de-allocate/destroy every other object.",,,,

While the process of retrieving original Python objects from the stored string representation is called unpickling.",,,,
323,OOPS,Python Object,How are arguments passed by value or by reference?,,Descriptive,1,"Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects. The references values are according to the functions; as a result, you cannot change the value of the references. However, you can change the objects if it is mutable.",,,,
324,Data Types,Python Operators,How can the ternary operators be used in python?,,Descriptive,1,"The Ternary operator is the operator that is used to show the conditional statements. This consists of the true or false values with a statement that has to be evaluated for it.
Syntax:
The Ternary operator will be given as:
[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]x, y = 25, 50big = x if x < y else y
Example:
The expression gets evaluated like if x<y else y, in this case if x<y is true then the value is returned as big=x and if it is incorrect then big=y will be sent as a result.",,,,
325,Data Structures,Python Strings,"Explain split(), sub(), subn() methods of “re” module in Python.",,Descriptive,1,"To modify the strings, Python’s “re” module is providing 3 methods. They are:
• split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.
• sub() – finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a different string
• subn() – it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along with the no. of replacements.",,,,
326,OOPS,Python Object,What is the difference between deep and shallow copy?,,Descriptive,1,"Shallow copy is used when a new instance type gets created and it keeps the values that are copied in the new instance. Shallow copy is used to copy the reference pointers just like it copies the values. These references point to the original objects and the changes made in any member of the class will also affect the original copy of it. Shallow copy allows faster execution of the program and it depends on the size of the data that is used.
Deep copy is used to store the values that are already copied. Deep copy doesn’t copy the reference pointers to the objects. It makes the reference to an object and the new object that is pointed by some other object gets stored. The changes made in the original copy won’t affect any other copy that uses the object. Deep copy makes execution of the program slower due to making certain copies for each object that is been called.",,,,
327,Framework,Testing Framework,What is unittest in Python?,,Descriptive,1,"A unit testing framework in Python is known as unittest. It supports sharing of setups, automation testing, shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections etc.",,,,
